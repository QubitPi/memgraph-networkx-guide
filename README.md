# ðŸ“š NetworkX guide

Welcome to the [NetworkX Guide website](https://www.networkx.guide) repository!

This site provides current and useful information about the NetworkX Python library for studying graphs and networks.

This project came to life because we noticed a lack of user-friendly materials and documentation surrounding the NetworkX library. With this site, we hope to combine all the relevant resources like guides, tutorials, references, etc. into an open platform that is free for everyone to use and contribute to. We would also like to emphasize the importance of graph analytics in fast evolving world of data.
