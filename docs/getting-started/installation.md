Install the current release of **networkx** with **pip**:

```
pip install networkx
```

To upgrade to a newer release use the `--upgrade` flag:

```
pip install --upgrade networkx
```

If you do not have permission to install software systemwide, you can install into your user directory using the `--user` flag:

```
pip install --user networkx
```

Alternatively, you can manually download networkx from [GitHub](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/releases) or [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkx). 
To install one of these versions, unpack it and run the following from the top-level source directory using the Terminal:

```
pip install .
```
